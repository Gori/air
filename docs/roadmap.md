# AIR - Development Roadmap

**AI-Readiness Assessment SaaS Tool**

*(React 19.1 · Next 15.3 · Supabase · Vercel · June 2025)*

---

## Build Rules

1. **Always build the minimal, clean, performant solution.**
2. **Always use the latest versions of everything.**
3. **Never build fallbacks or workarounds to anything.**
4. **Never add fluff, advertising copy, or show-only features.**
5. **Never build features that don't work.**
6. **Never run the dev server - always ask user to test.**

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL Development Rules**

**These rules are non-negotiable and must be followed strictly:**

- **MINIMAL ONLY**: Build the smallest possible solution that works
- **NO FLUFF**: No marketing copy, fancy designs, or unnecessary features
- **FUNCTIONAL ONLY**: Every feature must be fully working before building
- **NO DEV SERVER**: Never run `npm run dev` - always ask user to test
- **NO PLACEHOLDERS**: Never build placeholder or "coming soon" features

## 🧪 **MANDATORY Testing Rules**

**⚠️ CRITICAL: These rules are non-negotiable for all developers**

### Daily Testing Workflow
```bash
# Before starting work
npm run test:ci

# During development (keep running)
npm run test

# Before every commit (mandatory)
npm run test:all

# Before every PR (mandatory)  
npm run test:e2e
```

### Testing Requirements
- ✅ **80% minimum code coverage** (branches, functions, lines, statements)
- ✅ **All unit tests pass** before committing
- ✅ **All integration tests pass** before pushing
- ✅ **All E2E tests pass** before merging to main
- ✅ **Mock all external APIs** (OpenAI, Supabase, Clerk) in tests
- ✅ **Test RLS policies** for every database query
- ✅ **Pre-commit hooks** must be installed and working

### Testing Stack
- **Jest 29+**: Unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library 14+**: Component testing  
- **Playwright 1.45+**: End-to-end testing
- **Husky + lint-staged**: Pre-commit testing enforcement

- Created modular lib structure for scalability

**Phase 3-4 (Completed Implementation):**
- **Database Schema**: Changed from UUID to TEXT for all user/company IDs to work directly with Clerk user IDs
- **RLS Strategy**: Use admin client (service role) for API operations instead of RLS-enabled client to avoid JWT complexity
- **Authentication Flow**: Full integration between Clerk and Supabase with proper metadata syncing
- **AI Integration**: GPT-4.1 model (gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14) configured via environment variable
- **Survey System**: Complete question flow with AI-powered follow-up questions (simplified to 1 per question)
- **UI Components**: Added UserButton for logout functionality in dashboard and survey pages
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error states throughout the application
- **Performance**: Optimized database operations and AI token usage
